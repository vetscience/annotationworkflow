# annotationworkflow

The annotation process is divided into three stages (Each stage can be individually modified according to the species that need to be annotated):

 1. Data procurement 
 2. Annotation
 3. Visualization
 
 For data procurement:
 (1) Operation of signal peptide 
 (2) Operation of structure modelling 
 (3) Operation of quality control 
 
 For annotation:
 (1) EggNOG
 (2) InterProScan
 (3) DeepFRI-seq
 (4) DeepFRI-str
 (5) FATCAT-CATH
 (6) Operation of combination 
 
 For visualization:
 (1) GO visualization  
 (2) Upset-plot
